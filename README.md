## Running your own instance
Make sure you have at least Python 3.7 installed (that's the most recent version it has been tested on).
```
>>> git clone https://github.com/QuaKe8782/PartsBot.git
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
>>> python db_schema.py
```
Now fill in `credentials.json`. You will need to provide a discord bot token, an apex tracker API key (https://apex.tracker.gg/site-api), a reddit account username and password, a reddit application client ID, a reddit application client secret and a bot command prefix unless you wish to keep it as `,`.
```
